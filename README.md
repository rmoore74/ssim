# SSim - Spark S(ubmit)implified
Spark Submit simplified.

Simplify your spark submit process without the need to assemble your code into a .jar file that carries all the Spark dependencies in the world.

Contain your dependencies and SparkSubmit paramaters in a .json file in the root of your folder and simply direct SSim to your target .jar file.

Working in progress.
